# Drugs, Side Effects, and Medical Condition
This project revolves around the different medical conditions and the drugs related to cure them

---

## üéØ Aim of the Project
This project is specified towards the different diseases, medical conditions, and symptoms that are showed when someone falls ill. It also prescribes the drugs related to specific medical conditions and what could be the possible side effects that would arise if taken in incorrect manner.

---

## üñäÔ∏è Objectives
1. Analyze the Relationship Between Drugs, Medical Conditions, and Side Effects:</br>
To understand how specific drugs are associated with particular medical conditions and identify common or severe side effects. This involves parsing textual data and quantifying relationships, which helps in determining drug efficacy and risk.
</br>

2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</br>
To use EDA techniques (e.g., histograms, boxplots, heatmaps) to visualize trends, distributions, and patterns in the dataset. This includes analyzing:</br>
- Ratings distribution</br>
- Side effect frequency</br>
- Most common conditions treated</br>
</br>

3. Identify the Most Commonly Used Drugs per Condition:</br>
To group and rank drugs based on the frequency of their use in treating particular medical conditions (e.g., Acne, Pain, Diabetes). This helps in understanding drug popularity and prescribing patterns.
</br>

4. Investigate High-Risk Side Effects:</br>
To isolate and track severe or frequently occurring side effects (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing). This objective supports public health and pharmaceutical research by identifying drugs with high adverse effect rates.
</br>

5. Classify and Count Drug Categories:</br>
To extract and count how often each drug class appears (e.g., antibiotics, antihistamines, topical steroids). This provides insights into which drug classes are prevalent for specific conditions or side effects.
</br>

6. Examine Drug Safety Based on Pregnancy Categories:</br>
To evaluate the risk profiles of drugs during pregnancy (Categories A to X, and N/Unknown). This objective helps in understanding which drugs are safer or riskier for pregnant patients.
</br>

7. Assess Prescription Type Distribution (Rx/OTC):</br>
To determine how many drugs are Prescription-only (Rx), Over-the-Counter (OTC), or both (Rx/OTC). This gives regulatory and accessibility insights into medication availability.
</br>

8. Measure Drug Effectiveness Using Ratings and Reviews:</br>
To analyze average user ratings and number of reviews for each drug, which indicates perceived effectiveness, satisfaction, and usage popularity. Useful for comparing patient-reported outcomes.
</br>

9. Understand Drug Abuse Potential (CSA Classification):</br>
To classify drugs based on their Controlled Substances Act (CSA) Schedule (1‚Äì5, N, U, M), helping identify those with high abuse potential versus safer alternatives.
</br>

10. Prepare the Dataset for Machine Learning Models:</br>
To clean, encode, and scale the dataset using preprocessing steps like:</br>
- Label encoding categorical values (e.g., side effects, CSA, Rx_OTC)</br>
- Handling missing data</br>
- Feature scaling for modeling tasks like clustering or classification</br>
- This ensures the data is ready for building predictive models or rule-mining (e.g., Apriori).</br>

## üîë Key Processes
1. Data Collection and Understanding:</br>
- Source: The dataset was collected from public databases like drugs.com and Kaggle.
- Content Overview: It contains 17 columns and over 2,900 rows detailing drug names, associated medical conditions, side effects, drug classes, ratings, pregnancy risk categories, CSA scheduling, and more.
- Objective: To understand the scope of the data ‚Äî what each column represents, how it contributes to the analysis, and how it can be linked to real-world healthcare insights.
</br>

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:</br>
- Handling Missing Values: Replacing nulls in key columns (side_effects, drug_classes, generic_name, etc.) with placeholders like 'Unknown', 0, or category-appropriate defaults.
- Data Encoding: Applied label encoding to convert categorical data (e.g., pregnancy_category, rx_otc, side_effects) into numerical format for machine learning.
- Feature Transformation: Cleaned the activity column by removing % and converting to float, transformed alcohol column into binary interaction (1 for "interacts", 0 for "no interaction").
- Output: A fully sanitized and numerical dataset ready for analysis and modeling.
</br>

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization:</br>
- Univariate Analysis: Distribution plots of drug ratings, counts of side effects, and CSA schedules to understand individual variable behavior.
- Bivariate Analysis: Boxplots of drug ratings by drug class, frequency comparisons between drug types and medical conditions.
- Frequency Extraction: Used techniques like text parsing and tokenization to extract and count:
- Most common side effects
- Most prescribed drug classes
- Frequently treated medical conditions
- Visualization Tools: Used matplotlib and seaborn to visualize heatmaps, bar graphs, histograms, and distribution curves.
</br>

4. Feature Engineering and Transformation for Modeling:</br>
- Boolean Columns: Created new binary columns to indicate the presence of specific side effects (Hives, Itching, etc.) and conditions (Acne, Pain, etc.).
- Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to normalize the dataset for better model performance.
- Correlation Analysis: Generated heatmaps to visualize interdependencies and identify impactful features.
- Association Rules (Optional): Introduced Apriori algorithm to uncover relationships like ‚ÄúIf a drug treats Acne, it is likely to belong to class X and cause side effect Y.‚Äù
</br>

5. Result Interpretation and Reporting:</br>
Insights Generated:
- Which drugs are most used for common conditions like Acne or Pain.
- Side effects that are widespread across multiple drugs.
- Ratings trends by drug class or medical condition.
- Deliverables: Cleaned datasets, visual reports (plots, charts), and CSV files summarizing side effect counts, condition frequencies, and drug class distributions.
- Use Cases: Beneficial for healthcare analysts, pharmacologists, and regulatory bodies to understand drug risks, recommend alternatives, or design safer treatment plans.
